# ðŸ“š Book Review Sentiment Classifier  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project is a **machine learning-based sentiment analysis tool** that classifies book reviews as **positive** or **negative**. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model converts review text into numerical features and predicts sentiment with high accuracy.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Perform **text preprocessing** and feature engineering on book review data.  
- Apply **TF-IDF vectorization** to transform text into numerical features.  
- Train and evaluate **multiple machine learning models** (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM).  
- Optimize model performance using **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.  

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook  

---

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- **Best Model:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- **Accuracy:** 82%  
- **Optimization:** Logistic Regression tuned with GridSearchCV also achieved 82% accuracy with balanced metrics.
